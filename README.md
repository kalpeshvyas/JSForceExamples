Sample application to showcase the example to send a platform event and show it one the page of html (home.pug).
First of all you need to create a platform event "Account_Notification__e" in salesforce

then you can add a field with api "Account_Status__c"
create a record via workbench or via developer console.

and run this app in your localhost. (use command "nodemon index.js" in your current directory.)

The event will get capture and shown on the page.
